# Overview

**Rasengan UI** is a free, open-source **component registry** built for modern React applications.

Instead of shipping a heavy npm package, Rasengan UI lets you **copy only the components you need** directly into your codebase — fully owned, fully customizable, no lock-in.

Powered and inspired by the philosophy of **[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation)**, Rasengan UI focuses on:

* clarity over abstraction
* ownership over dependency
* quality over quantity


## What is a component registry?

A component registry is a catalog of reusable UI components that you **install as source code**, not as a black-box dependency.

With Rasengan UI:

* components live **inside your project**
* you can edit them freely
* updates are opt-in, not forced
* there is no runtime dependency

You stay in control.


## Who is Rasengan UI for?

Rasengan UI is designed for:

* developers who want **production-ready UI**
* teams that value **customization**
* builders who dislike over-engineered UI kits
* creators working on:

  * marketing websites
  * dashboards
  * internal tools
  * SaaS products

It works with **any React setup**:

* [Rasengan.js](https://rasengan.dev)
* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com)
* [TanStack](https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/react/quick-start)
* [Vite](https://vite.dev)


## Component categories

Rasengan UI components are organized into clear categories.

### Marketing components

Used to build public-facing pages.

Examples:

* Hero sections
* Navbars
* Footers
* Pricing sections
* Testimonials
* Call-to-action blocks

These components focus on **layout, content, and conversion**.


### Application UI components

Used to build interactive products and tools.

Examples:

* Sidebars
* Dashboards
* Forms
* Data tables
* Modals
* Command menus

These components focus on **structure, usability, and state**.

## Design principles

Rasengan UI follows a few simple rules:

### 1. Copy > Install

You own the code. Always.

### 2. Minimal abstraction

Components are readable and boring (in a good way).

### 3. Tailwind-first

Built with Tailwind CSS and CSS variables for easy theming.

### 4. Accessible by default

Keyboard navigation and sensible ARIA patterns where applicable.

### 5. Free and open-source

Forever.


## How it works

1. Browse components in the documentation
2. Install a component via the registry CLI (or manually)
3. The component is added to your project as source code
4. Customize it however you want

No package updates. No magic. No surprises.
