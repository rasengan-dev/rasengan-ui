# Changelog

## February 2026 — Turning Rasengan UI into an Open Source project

Rasengan UI officially becomes **open source and free for everyone**.

This marks a major shift in direction: Rasengan UI is now distributed as a **shadcn-compatible component registry**, allowing developers to copy components directly into their codebase with full ownership.

Key changes:

* Transition to an open-source model (MIT license)
* Introduction of a registry-based distribution
* Removal of premium access and delivery all the available components (100+) for free
* Public contribution guidelines
* Strong focus on quality, clarity, and long-term maintainability

This decision reinforces the core philosophy of Rasengan UI:
**ownership over abstraction, simplicity over lock-in**.



## November 2025 — Introduction of Kira Board Template

The **Kira Board** template is introduced as a **Kanban board application**, inspired by tools like **Trello** and **Jira**.

It focuses on task management and productivity workflows, showcasing:

* draggable columns and cards
* task creation and organization
* status-based workflows
* practical Application UI patterns

Kira Board serves as a real-world example of how Rasengan UI components can be composed to build complex, interactive applications.



## November 2025 — Introduction of Levelup Template

The **Levelup** template is released as a **personal portfolio website**.


Compared to `Plus Ultra`, it provides:

* a simple way to showcase your work
* perfect for designers, photographers, not just developers
* easy and simple layout
* an extensible structure for more features

Levelup demonstrates how Rasengan UI marketing components can be used to create a polished personal presence with minimal customization.



## October 2025 — Introduction of Plus Ultra Template

**Plus Ultra** is introduced as a bold and expressive **personal portfolio template**.

Designed for developers and creators, it highlights:

* personal branding
* design similar to a social media app
* project showcases
* experience and skills sections
* clean, modern layouts

Plus Ultra shows that Rasengan UI can support both minimal and highly personalized designs without sacrificing consistency.



## August 2025 — Announcing Rasengan UI

Rasengan UI is officially announced as a **collection of reusable React UI components** built with Tailwind CSS.

The initial vision focuses on:

* composable UI blocks
* developer experience
* framework-agnostic usage
* practical, real-world components

This announcement lays the foundation for what would later evolve into a registry-first, open-source ecosystem.
